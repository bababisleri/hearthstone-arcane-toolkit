## 🧠 How It Works

The core harnesses the **OpenAI** (GPT-4 Turbo) and **Claude** (Anthropic's language model) APIs, weaving stateful real-time strategy hints and metagame analytics into your Hearthstone session.  
Custom scripts safely interpret game memory, event logs, and current board state, then feed this data to powerhouse APIs for recommendation generation.

*Examples:*
- Facing an odd board? The Match Simulator instantly predicts three play outcomes for your next turn, colored by likely opponent reacts using Claude's deep strategy heuristics.
- Final card in hand? OpenAI-driven chatbot serves up potential combos spotted only in the freshest meta reports.

Everything runs locally—cloud comms only for AI suggestions, non-gamebreaking, respecting game TOS and user privacy.
